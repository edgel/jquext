Requirements to build your own jQuext
--------------------------------------

Similar with build jQuery, you need to have GNU make 3.8 or later, Node.js 0.4.12 or later, and git 1.7 or later.
(Earlier versions might work OK, but are not tested.)

Windows users have two options:

1. Install [msysgit](https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/) (Full installer for official Git),
   [GNU make for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm), and a
   [binary version of Node.js](http://node-js.prcn.co.cc/). Make sure all three packages are installed to the same
   location (by default, this is C:\Program Files\Git).
2. Install [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/) (make sure you install the git, make, and which packages), then either follow
   the [Node.js build instructions](https://github.com/ry/node/wiki/Building-node.js-on-Cygwin-%28Windows%29) or install
   the [binary version of Node.js](http://node-js.prcn.co.cc/).

Mac OS users should install Xcode (comes on your Mac OS install DVD, or downloadable from
[Apple's Xcode site](http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html)) and
[http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/](Homebrew). Once Homebrew is installed, run `brew install git` to install git,
and `brew install node` to install Node.js.

Linux/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install make, git, and node, or build from source
if you swing that way. Easy-peasy.
